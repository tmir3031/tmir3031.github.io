                <h2> The Etymology and Definition of Dance </h2>
                <p>
                    Dancing involves moving the body rhythmically, often in a choreographed way and usually to music. Dance can express
                    aesthetic ideas and emotions as a form of performance art presented to an audience. People also dance in
                    nonperformance situations to release energy, express emotion, connect with other people, or just enjoy the feeling
                    of movement.
                </p>
                <p> The word "dance" originates from Old French "dancer" (verb) and "dance" (noun). </p>

                    „Dance is the hidden language of the soul.” – Martha Graham

                <h2> The Origins of Dance </h2>
                <p>
                    Dance has a long history, with origins dating back to prehistory. The earliest evidence comes from cave
                    paintings discovered in caves in India, dating to around 8000 BCE, and from Egyptian tombs from 3300 BCE, where
                    dance was often associated with religious rituals. In Ancient Greece, dance was part of ceremonies dedicated to
                    the god Dionysus and the ancient Olympic Games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Asia, dance has held deep cultural significance. Classical Indian dances like Bharatanatyam have a history of
                    thousands of years, and in China, ceremonial and folk dances, such as the dragon dance and lion dance, date back
                    over 3,000 years.

                <p>
                    In Europe, folk dances from the Middle Ages evolved into ballroom dances during the Renaissance, becoming an
                    important part of social life in royal courts. In the 19th century, dances like the waltz became globally
                    popular, and in the 20th century, social dances focused on couples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The origins of dance are closely tied to ancient rituals, stories, and ceremonies of human communities. Dance
                    was used to invoke deities, celebrate the seasons, tell stories, or accompany important moments.
